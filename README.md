# SFD-BMD Calculator

üåü **Exciting News!** üåü

I'm thrilled to announce the launch of my latest project inspired by Dr. Ayyanna Habal - a Beam Analysis Tool website under development! üõ†Ô∏è

## Features
1. **Shear Force Diagram (SFD):** Visualizes the distribution of shear forces along the beam.
2. **Bending Moment Diagram (BMD):** Illustrates the bending moments along the beam's length.
3. **Interactive Inputs:** Easily input load, beam length, and point load distance.
4. **Unit Selection:** Choose units for load and length, making it flexible for different scenarios.
5. **Real-time Calculations:** Computes reactions, maximum shear force, and maximum bending moment instantly.
6. **Clear Results Display:** Presents reaction forces and maximum values with chosen units.
7. **User-friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive design for easy navigation and usage.

## How It Works
1. **Initialize the Inputs:** Set up the load, beam length, and point load distance.
2. **Select Units:** Choose the units for load and length.
3. **Real-time Calculation:** Instantly computes and displays the shear force and bending moment diagrams.
4. **Clear Results:** Display the computed reactions, shear force, and bending moment values clearly.

## Requirements
- Python
- Flask

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SFD-BMD-calculator.git
   ```
2. Install the required libraries:

   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
Run the application:
```bash
python app.py
```

## Collaboration
